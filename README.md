         A Search Engine for education.
        <br><br>
        <h3 id="problem_solving"><u>How will we solve the problem?</u></h3>
        <p> We mostly use the concept of web scraping to provide the results of the searches in the engine. The programming language used is Python
        along with some of its modules like BeautifulSoup and Requests for scraping data from some of the popular websites and resources available for educational purposes in the web.
        <br>
        The application features are made using the Python web framework, Flask as it does not require particular tools, libraries and database abstraction layer.
        Any education related information is scraped from reddit pages and web forums on different subjects available online. 
        </p><br>
        <h3 id="final_demo"><u>What will be our Final Demo?</u></h3>
        <p>A search Engine which focuses only on providing educational resources to users. The resources will be
        categorized based on the fields they are relavant
        such as Science, Videos, Files, Social media, IT.
        <br>Users can visit the field of their choice and browse all of
        the information they want in a specific subject.
        Here, users will be provided with the information based on their choice in a particular field be it a video, a
        book or even a research paper which is available to the public!
        <br>
        Everything
        made available to the users here is purely educational and can never be misused by a third party individual or
        an organization. The information browsed on the Science tab returns research papers on different experiments and
        inventions. Those browsed on the forums tab
        returns doubts and answers available on online forums. The Files tab returns popular books on the browsed
        subject.
        The information browsed on the IT tab redirects the users to various online educational platforms like github
        and stackoverflow and also tech support
        if the users face any issues in any domain. Those browsed on the Videos tab redirects the users to popular
        videos of online courses and other educational videos based on the search.
        <br>
        This Search Engine is better than most others in various aspects like no ads and pop ups, any data which does
        not belong to the domain of education is strictly restricted
        and the users will find this to be a really smooth experience in the process of learning without any
        distractions.

        <u><h3 id="tools_used">Which tech stack or tools have we used?</h3></u>
        <p>We have used Python Flask for frontend, python modules like BeautifulSoup and Requests for scraping data (backend)</p>
        <br>
        <u><h3 id="impl_progress">How much have we implemented?</h3></u>
        <p>We have placed all 5 tabs in a basic structure through which the user can browse the choice of their field</p><br>
        <p>In the next 24 hours, we will build the frontend and some finishing touches to format our search engine.</p>
        <br>
        <u><h3 id="face_issue">Are we facing any issues?</h3></u>
        <p>Yes. It is hard to scrape data from some of the websites as they use cloudfare to block bots and to avoid third part access to their data.
            So, we have to find proxys through which we can scrape them and use it.</p>
        </p>
        <u><h3 id="text_app">How to test our app?</h3></u>
        <p>These are just normal python files. <br> Run the above files with command: </p>
        <code>python3 {your-desired-app}.py</code><br>
        <p>For example: </p>
        <code>python3 files.py</code><br>
        <p>to run files tab.</p>
